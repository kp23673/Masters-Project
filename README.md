# Masters-Project
Predicting Cancer Type from Symptom Descriptions

# About Dataset

- For Biomedical text document classification, abstract and full papers(whose length less than or equal to 6 pages) available and used. This dataset focused on long research paper whose page size more than 6 pages. Dataset includes cancer documents to be classified into 3 categories like 'Thyroid_Cancer','Colon_Cancer','Lung_Cancer'.
  
- Total publications=7569. it has 3 class labels in dataset.
number of samples in each categories:
colon cancer=2579, lung cancer=2180, thyroid cancer=2810

# Problem Statement:

The early detection of cancer is crucial for effective treatment, but many patients initially present with vague or ambiguous symptoms. Accurately predicting the type of cancer based on symptom descriptions can help in early diagnosis and appropriate referral. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the type of cancer from a patient's symptom description using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, providing a potential tool for healthcare professionals to support early detection and improve patient outcomes.

# Description:
- Built a pipeline to predict cancer types from textual symptom descriptions using Python and NLTK.
- Performed data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization to explore patterns in symptoms.
- Trained machine learning models like Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes.
- Implemented LSTM and BERT models to improve prediction accuracy using deep learning.
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure optimal performance.
